## Introduction

The Marvel Universe is a fictional universe based on Marvel Comics. Marvel has
released many movies, TV shows and comics, but the main data focus of this report will be
regarding viewer reviews and ratings of Marvel TV shows, both live-action and animated, since
the first shows in 1966. We will also attempt to examine which other factors may have impacted
these numbers

#### Research Questions
- Does the number of IMDb reviews a Marvel TV show receives correlate with its
numerical score?
- Can common castâ€™s character predict classes?
- How do shows which appear on streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, etc.) compare to
those which appear on broadcast television (Fox, CBS, etc.)?
- How do Rotten Tomatoes audience scores compare to the critic scores in regards to
Marvel TV shows?
